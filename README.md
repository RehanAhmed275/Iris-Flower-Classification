# Iris-Flower-Classification
The Iris Flower Classification project aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify Iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal measurements. The dataset used in this project is the well-known Iris dataset, consisting of three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.
